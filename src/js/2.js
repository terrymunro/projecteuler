 * Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers                                          *

 * Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous *
 * two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:            *
 *   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...                                    *
 * By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not      *
 * exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.                 *
